# Project-1-griffins
    Hotel Finder

# Description
- This project offers users the perfect interactive tool to help them find the right hotel for their next vacation or travel assignment. 

# User Story
- When the user opens up the page then can type in a city or enter a zip code. When they hit search, then the browser will use the first API URL to present the user with a list of the top hotels in that area to choose from. This will include the number of stars and a picture of the hotel. When a user clicks on a hotel, then the browser will open up another HTML page with an overview of the hotel. This will include an enlarged picture, pricing, and more details. When user clicks on drop down menu, then they can select one category to search proximity for in reference to their hotel 
            -Restaurants 
            -Museums
            -Clothing stores
When a user picks a category then the browser uses the 2nd API to show listings of places in that category that are within a 10 mile radius to the user's chosen hotel.
