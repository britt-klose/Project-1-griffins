# Project-1-griffins
    Hotel Finder

# Description
- This project offers users the perfect interactive tool to help them find the right hotel for their next vacation or travel assignment. 

# User Story
- When the user opens up the page, then they are presented with the home page and a search bar where they can type in the name of any city.
- When the user hits the discover button, then the browser will use the first API call to present the user with cards of the top 6 hotels in that area to choose from. Each card will include the hotel’s name, number of stars, address, price per night, and a small picture of the hotel. 
- When a user clicks on a hotel, then the browser presents them with an overview of the chosen hotel. This will include the hotel name, location, a URL, an enlarged picture, and pricing.
- When a user clicks on the URL, then they are brought to the hotel's listing on booking.com
- When the user views the hotel overview page, then a second API call is used to bring a list of items to the right side of the page denoting four activities to do within one mile of the user’s intended destination. 
- When a user clicks on the home button or the Griffin icon in the top left of the page, then they are brought back to the original home page. 
- When a user hovers over the more dropdown menu, then the user is shown options for (Top Destinations, COVID Restrictions, and Report an Issue.)
- When the user clicks on Top Destinations, then they are brought to travel.USnews.com and are shown rankings for "World's best Places to Visit". 
- When the user clicks on COVID Restrictions, then they are brought to the CDC website and shown the article for "Travel Restrictions to Prevent the Spread of Disease"
- When the user clicks on Report an Issue, then their email is brought up addressed to Sam Meske's email, where they can report any issue they have with the website.
